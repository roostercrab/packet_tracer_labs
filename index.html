        <img src="./images/plug_in_the_router_2.png" alt="">
        <li>You should now have a completed connection, but the link won't come up until we "no shut" the router port; we will configure the devices in the next lesson</li>
        <li>Repeat for the connection between the switch and the computer, plugging the straight thru into port fa0/1 on the switch and fa0 on the computer</li>

        <li>This connection should come up with green on both ends within 30 seconds, if you don't feel like waiting you can use the fast forward button on the bottom left part of the screen</li>

        <li>The connections are now completed and we can configure them in the next lesson</li>
        <img src="./images/completed.png" alt="">
        <li>It's important to save your work early and often. In real life you should save it on the devices, in Packet Tracer you should save it on your computer with the time and date so you can go back and check your old files if you need to</li>
